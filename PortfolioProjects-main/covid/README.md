COVID-19 In West Africa Dashboard

This project presents an interactive COVID-19 Dashboard built in Power BI to visualize the global impact of the pandemic. Using a cleaned COVID-19 dataset, I designed a dashboard that highlights trends in confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and country-level comparisons.

The goal was to make the data easy to understand at a glance and provide policymakers, health analysts, and the public with insights into how the pandemic evolved across regions and time.
